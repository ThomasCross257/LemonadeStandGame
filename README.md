# LemonadeStandGame

Welcome to our Lemonade Stand Game! This was a project made for our CIS Programming 1 class with the intent of making a fully functioning Lemonade Stand game. 
This game features the following:

-Text and Integer Input commands
-A time function for the actual game itself that can be set by the player
-Simulating an inventory and purchasing system for the player to buy goods with the funds they earn
-And of course a noteriety function that works as a sort of multiplier for the player's customers

Commands:
Commands in game come in several different forms. These are:
Full-Word Commands: Full word commands require you to type the word out exactly as it is presented. 
An indicator of what to type into the program is: 'Example Input'

Letter-Only Commands: Letter only commands require you to input a single letter. It can be uppercase or lowercase 'A'. 
Some might come with periods afterwards, those should not be added.

Integer commands: These commands usually come without any indication of limited commands. 
This will usually appear whenever you are trying to: Set your recipe or setting the timescale the simulation runs at.
